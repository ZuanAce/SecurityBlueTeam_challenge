# Introduction
Google dorks, or Google hacks, are specific search queries that you type in the Google search. In return, Google presents you with targeted search results. With Google dorks, you can search for key phrases or topics in specific websites, find specific file types, cached versions of web pages, and more.

# Activity
In the below screenshot, I am performing simple reconnaissance on the domain Google.com, using Duckduckgo as the data source:
using the command *theHarvester -d google.com -l 100 -b duckduckgo*
(tool) (target domain = google.com) (list 100 results max) (source = duckduckgo)

**Notes**: Some of the sources such as linkedin, twitter, and google can't be used anymore since version 4.2.0
