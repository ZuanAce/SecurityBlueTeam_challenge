# Challenge Scenario
Alexis is a fictional cybersecurity company with thousands of employees. An attacker has gained unauthorized entry into its premises and has connected their laptop to an unused port on a switch. The attacker now has access to the companyâ€™s internal networks. Within the internal network, there is a central server where critical proprietary data is stored. In this capture, the attacker is attempting to collect SSH credentials that they can use to log into the central server.
# PCAP 3
1. What is the MAC address of the attacker?

   **Filtered SSH Packets:**
   - Applied *ssh*  filter in Wireshark to narrow down packets to 142 for inspection.

   **Conversations Analysis:**
   - Examined Statistics > Conversations, revealing only two devices communicating via SSH.

2. What is the type of attack which is taking place that allows the attacker to listen in on conversations between the central server and another host?

   - Just a simple google search will find the answer
   - Man-in-the-Middle
     
3. What is the file which was downloaded from the central server?

   **Protocol Overview:*8
   - Navigated to Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy in Wireshark to analyze all protocols in the PCAP file.
   - Identified FTP traffic under the TCP protocol.
   - FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It's a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network.

   **FTP Packet Inspection:**
   - Returned to the main screen and applied an FTP filter using ftp in the display filter.
   - Selected packet 550 and followed the TCP stream.
   - File Name: Alevis_Employee_Information_Chart.csv

4. What department does Borden Danilevich work in?

   **Filter FTP Traffic:**
   - Applied the FTP filter by typing ftp in the display filter box in Wireshark.
   - Followed the TCP stream and selected Stream 1 from the lower-right corner of the open window.
   - Revealed the contents of the CSV file within the TCP stream.

# Thanks for Reading!!
Completing the Network Analysis course was a significant achievement for me. I faced challenges, particularly because I lacked sufficient networking knowledge. However, the learning experience was incredibly valuable, and I gained a wealth of knowledge. I would enthusiastically recommend this course to beginners who are looking to learn more about networking.
