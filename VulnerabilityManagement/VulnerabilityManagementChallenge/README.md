# Challenge Scenario
You are looking to move into a Vulnerability Analyst position within the security team, but first you have to prove your skills. You have been asked to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the intentionally vulnerable system, Metasploitable 2. You are required to work individually to conduct a scan of the system using Nessus (preferably within Kali Linux), you will host both systems yourself in virtual machines. You have been given a report template, which you must fill out completely and submit to be considered for the new role. Download the template to your local machine, conduct the scan, and fill out the questions, before uploading your report in the next section.

Due to the volume of students, we are unable to provide any form of feedback. We strongly encourage students to join our Discord server (link on the homepage) and share their reports or findings with other students in the “#Intro to Vuln Managament" channel.

# Challenge Requirement
- Metasploit 2
