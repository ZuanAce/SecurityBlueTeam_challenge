# Activity Scenario and Prerequisites 
For this activity, you’ll need to have your MS2 virtual machine running, and a Kali Linux virtual machine which you’ll use for scanning. You need to answer the below questions, so conduct your scans and gather the answers ready for submission in the quiz.

Before scanning, make sure your Nmap version is 7.80 otherwise, your results won’t be the same as the answer to the question. If you would like to know your Nmap version, type nmap –version. Kali Linux version 2020.3 and below will work.
