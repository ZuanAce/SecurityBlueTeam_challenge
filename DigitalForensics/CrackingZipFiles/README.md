7. Navigate to Stego Files using the command *cd 'Stego Files'*. Using the command *ls* to list all the files withing the directory. There are 7 files to be sorted. Luckily, this is not a lot. If we had a huge amount of files to sort through, the StegDetect tool would have been used. It is a tool that detects steganographic content in images.

8. Using the command *steghide extract -sf filename* (replace the desired filename within the directory) to extract the embedded files for the flags. Through trial and error, I was able to find FLAG1.txt within the *pizza.jpg* file using the password *christmastree*. Using the *cat* command, I was able to retrieve the first flag *kAN105KS*.

9. Repeat step 7 to find the remaining flag files. The second flag (*001JDANL*) was found within the *verypretty.jpg* file using the password *darksky123*. The third flag (*1LRBA9IU*) was found within the *car.jpeg* file using the password *goldenwatch*.
